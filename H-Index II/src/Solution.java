/*
    Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
    write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

    According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at
    least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

    Example:

    Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
                 received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
                 Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
                 two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
    Note:

    If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

    Follow up:

    This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
    Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?

     * Change the descriptions to below which is easy to understand the problem:

     *
     * To solve this problem, we should first sort the array (in this version II, it is sorted already)
     *      1. at any index i, check citations[i] >= len - i (means the rest of element numbers)
     *      2. if so, return len - i because and index j > i, the result (n - j) < (n - i), so (n - i) is the max.
