    Given a stream of numbers, generate a random number from the stream. You are allowed to use only O(1) space
    and the input is in the form of a stream, so canâ€™t store the previously seen numbers.

     * This can be applied to many random related questions. If we don't know the length of an array (0..n), how do we
     * maintain the probability of 1/n for each element?
     *
     * When looping through each element in the stream, first n - 1 element's probability is 1 / (n - 1).
     * When we loop to the element n, to make element n - 1 to be probability 1/n, the factor is (n - 1 / n) because
     * (1 / n - 1) * (n - 1 / n) == 1/n
     *
     * The programming is quite simple: if counter == 1 (means the first element), return 1.
     * Then we select a random number between 0..(counter-1), if the INDEX of newly added element x equals counter-1,
     * x is returned as selected element. Don't know how this applied to the above calculation.
     *
     * This can be used for many other problems like get a random node on tree or linked lists etc.
